          A simple social network application with similar features to the 2004 version of the Facebook.
          The project was for my Software Engineering Methods and Tools class from my last semester at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
          I had two partners for the Project, Matt Binsfeld and Jordan Tsiao.  The application was developed using Behavior
          Driven Design with Cucumber, Test Driven Development with RSpec, and was tracked using Pivotal Tracker.
          Feel free to create a profile and check it out.

          A twitter style application made using the Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl. The book teaches Test Driven Development
          techniques using RSpec and opened my eyes to Ruby on Rails web development.
